# Social Distancing Detector 

Hi Guys This is Day-1 of 15 days of Deep learning 

This project aims to detect people who are closer than the thresold in Covid era using Yolo weights .


##  Getting Started


This project is done in GoogleColab , You can do it in any ide like Pycharm or even in kaggle

In golab 

This section downloads all the yolo pre trained weights, yolo config and also the class name which is coco.names
```bash
import os

# Create a directory to store YOLO model files
os.makedirs("yolo-coco", exist_ok=True)

# Download YOLO model weights
!wget -q -O yolo-coco/yolov3.weights https://pjreddie.com/media/files/yolov3.weights

# Download YOLO model configuration
!wget -q -O yolo-coco/yolov3.cfg https://raw.githubusercontent.com/pjreddie/darknet/master/cfg/yolov3.cfg

# Download COCO names file
!wget -q -O yolo-coco/coco.names https://raw.githubusercontent.com/pjreddie/darknet/master/data/coco.names

```

Also you need a pesdestrian.mp4 video file , its been put my in the repo.
## Lessons Learned
- cv2: This is the OpenCV library, which is used for computer vision tasks such as image processing, video capture, and object detection.
- numpy: A library used for numerical computations in Python, often used to handle arrays and matrices efficiently.
```bash
import cv2
import numpy as np
```

ðŸ”—**Load the Yolo model Model**

cv2.dnn.readNetFromDarknet is a function to Load all the weights and conf file from yolo-coco directory
```bash
net = cv2.dnn.readNetFromDarknet(
    os.path.join(Config.MODEL_PATH, "yolov3.cfg"),
    os.path.join(Config.MODEL_PATH, "yolov3.weights")
)

```

ðŸ”—**Load the Yolo model class names from coco-names**

LABELS: A list containing the names of the classes that YOLO can detect, such as "person", "bicycle", "car", etc.
```bash
labelsPath = os.path.join(Config.MODEL_PATH, "coco.names")
LABELS = open(labelsPath).read().strip().split("\n")
```

**Get Yolo output layer**

- net.getLayerNames(): Gets the names of all the layers in the YOLO model.
- net.getUnconnectedOutLayers(): Gets the indices of the output layers of the YOLO model.
- ln[i - 1] for i in net.getUnconnectedOutLayers(): Creates a list of the names of the output layers. The -1 is used because OpenCV's layer indexing is 1-based, while Python's list indexing is 0-based.
- ln: A list of the names of the output layers of the YOLO model.
```bash
ln = net.getLayerNames()
ln = [ln[i - 1] for i in net.getUnconnectedOutLayers()]

```

**The function def detect_people** - The detect_people function processes an input frame to detect people using the YOLO model, applies non-maxima suppression to eliminate overlapping detections, and returns a list of detected people with their confidence scores, bounding boxes, and centroids

### Bounding Box Coordinates

A bounding box is defined by its top-left corner and its width and height. 

  (x, y)
  
    +-------------------------------+
    |                               |
    |                               |
    |                               |
    |                               |
    |          (centerX, centerY)   |
    |               +               |
    |                               |
    |                               |
    |                               |
    +-------------------------------+
                       (x + w, y + h)

```bash

if len(idxs) > 0:
    for i in idxs.flatten():
        (x, y) = (boxes[i][0], boxes[i][1])    # Top-left corner of the bounding box
        (w, h) = (boxes[i][2], boxes[i][3])    # Width and height of the bounding box
        r = (confidences[i], (x, y, x + w, y + h), centroids[i])
        results.append(r)

```

### Calculate Social Distancing Violations

```bash
violate = set()

if len(results) >= 2:
    centroids = np.array([r[2] for r in results])
    D = np.zeros((len(centroids), len(centroids)), dtype="float")

    for i in range(0, len(centroids)):
        for j in range(i + 1, len(centroids)):
            D[i, j] = euclidean_dist(centroids[i], centroids[j])

            if D[i, j] < Config.MIN_DISTANCE:
                violate.add(i)
                violate.add(j)
```
- violate: Set to keep track of the indices of people violating social distancing.
- centroids: Array of centroids of detected people.
- D: Distance matrix to store pairwise distances between centroids.
- Nested loops calculate the Euclidean distance between each pair of centroids. If the distance is less than the minimum safe distance (Config.MIN_DISTANCE), both indices are added to the violate set
